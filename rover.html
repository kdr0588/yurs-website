YURS has a constitutional objective of outreach, and to that end, the VPEO can schedule workshops, tours, school visits, and various other activities as deemed necessary to that end. The VPEO shall be responsible for establishing, maintaining, and preserving contacts between YURS and such organizations as may be contacted from time to time for the purpose of events or outreach activities. Coming off a year where little outreach was possible, the VPEO will have a chance to make a big impact as we hopefully return to a "normal" school year. This position is a full executive position, which means that there is a considerable role in club affairs, though it does not have signing authority.</p><p><a href="/join">Join us now</a> for an electrifying experience!</p></div><a href="#rover-point-4" class="button style2 down anchored">Next</a></section><section id="rover-point-4" class="main style2 left dark fullscreen"><div class="content box style2"><header><h2>Mechanical Team</h2></header><p>The mechanical team designs and builds our rovers that are used in competitions.
