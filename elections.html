Coming off a year where little outreach was possible, the VPEO will have a chance to make a big impact as we hopefully return to a "normal" school year.

Team leads are also responsible for ensuring their team has a consistent membership, as well as promotion within the team (e.g. subteam leads). This position is a major commitment and has a lot of responsibility. Team leads are not signing autFhorities, though they are the position that generally has the most spending attached to it.
