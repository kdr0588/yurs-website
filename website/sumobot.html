      The Sumobot team engineer small, autonomous robots designed to track down
      and push an opposing robot out of a ring. Competing in the annual McMaster
      Sumobot Competition, the Sumobot Team is a great place to work in a
      close-knit team to build up your skills in all areas of robotics. The team
      is open to all students, regardless of experience and major.

      <h2>Programming With Arduinos!</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      To power these little cute robots into the champions that they will be
      during the competition, we need to give their microporcessors instructions
      to follow. With the power of Arudino C, they shall gains the brains to win
      the competition. Never programmed? Don't worry, our workshops are designed to 
      get you started from nothing!

      <h2>Circuits! Circuit of life!</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      These little bots are centered around their simple circuit design.
      We already have a basic circuit laid out for you that you can 
      modify to your liking! Want more/differnt sensors? Another motor 
      for an arm? You can do it!

      <h2>CAD Modeling and 3D Printing.</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      Once you got your bot spinning it's wheels, how do you hold it all together? 
      You got to design your own enclosure using CAD! Some of our workshops will be 
      dedicated to learning Fusion 360 and the quirks of 3D printing. Once it's all 
      done we will 3D print the parts for you so you can asseemble your bot.
